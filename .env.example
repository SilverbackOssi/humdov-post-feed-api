# Database configuration
# Use in-memory SQLite for development/testing
# DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///:memory:

# For persistent storage, use a file 
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///humdov.db
# ### humdov.db is pre-populated with sample data
# ### each time you run `app/seed_data.py` it is cleared and re-populated.

# Note: In-memory database is faster but data will be lost when the app restarts.
# Use file-based database when working with seed data that you want to persist.
